# Portfolio

Week 2's homework assignment was to mkae a client portfolio. This mark down file will have a screenshot and the listed criteria. Our homework assignment this week involved us building a mobile friendly site from scratch, without being provided code. This was very educational to me, and I struggled a lot with CSS.

## User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## My Adventure

```
This was an incredibly difficult experience for me. Aligning the flexbox with the <img> in HTML did not work for me. I tried for probably 5 hours just getting the <img> to not work. I ended up using the background-image through CSS to get it to work, and doing it that way allowed me to use the <a> as the tag for the images; which allowed the whole image to be clicked. I really enjoyed the challenge and I am very excited to see how I progress.
